This repository contains the companion resources for the **AI Storage Blueprint**, a 4-stage framework for choosing the right storage for your AI/ML workloads on Google Cloud, as featured on the [@storagebites](https://www.youtube.com/@StorageBites) YouTube channel.

The goal of this blueprint is to provide a simple yet powerful evaluation matrix to help you analyze your workload's unique needs—from capacity and performance to access patterns and economics—to make the right choice at every stage of the AI lifecycle.

## **The 4 Stages of the AI Storage Blueprint**

### **Stage 1: PREPARE**

The goal is to build a massive, scalable data lake and efficiently transform raw data into a clean, organized format for training.

- **Workload:** Ingesting petabytes of raw data (JSON, logs, images, etc.), cleaning, and transforming it using pipelines like Apache Spark.
- **Key Challenge:** Handling immense scale at a low cost; avoiding millions of tiny files.
- **Primary Solution:** **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for its limitless scalability and low cost. Use features like AutoClass for automatic cost optimization. Bundle data into chunked formats like Apache Parquet.

### **Stage 2: TRAIN**

The goal is to feed a massive cluster of accelerators as fast as possible, minimizing idle compute time.

- **Workload:** Repeatedly reading a curated dataset of hundreds of terabytes. Access patterns can be large sequential reads or small random reads.
- **Key Challenge:** Maximizing I/O throughput and minimizing latency to keep expensive GPUs/TPUs saturated.
- **Primary Solutions:**
  - **Google Cloud Storage with GCS FUSE:** Best for large files (\>50MB) and cloud-native applications.
  - **Google Cloud Managed Service for Lustre:** Best for millions of small files, low-latency random reads, and applications requiring a strict POSIX-compliant parallel file system.

### **Stage 3: SERVE**

The goal is to load models onto serving instances as quickly as possible to minimize "time to first token."

- **Workload:** Reading model files (often hundreds of gigabytes) onto one or many serving nodes. Mostly a read-only pattern.
- **Key Challenge:** High-throughput, low-latency model loading, especially at scale.
- **Primary Solutions:**
  - **Google Cloud Storage with FUSE:** Good for low-cost, infrequent updates.
  - **Google Cloud Hyperdisk ML:** Best for serving at massive scale (\>100 nodes), allowing hundreds of VMs to read from the same disk simultaneously.
  - **Managed Service for Lustre:** Excellent for environments with frequent model updates (e.g., research labs, VFX studios).

### **Stage 4: ARCHIVE**

The goal is to store all key assets (prepared data, models, checkpoints) for the long term with maximum durability at the absolute lowest cost.

- **Workload:** Write-once, read-rarely.
- **Key Challenge:** Storing petabytes of critical data for years at the lowest possible cost per gigabyte.
- **Primary Solution:** **Google Cloud Storage** using colder storage classes like **Nearline**, **Coldline**, and **Archive**. Use Lifecycle policies or AutoClass to automate data tiering.
