### **Stage 1: PREPARE**

| Metric          | Requirement                     | Recommended Solution | Key Feature                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Capacity**    | Virtually Limitless (Petabytes) | Google Cloud Storage | Infinite Scalability             |
| **Performance** | High Throughput (for Ingest)    | Google Cloud Storage | Global Namespace, High Bandwidth |
| **Access**      | Universal, Simple API           | Google Cloud Storage | S3-Compatible API, SDKs          |
| **Economics**   | Lowest Cost per Gigabyte        | Google Cloud Storage | AutoClass, Lifecycle Policies    |

### **Stage 2: TRAIN**

| Metric          | Requirement                    | Recommended Solution(s)    | Key Feature                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Capacity**    | Curated Dataset (100s of TBs)  | GCS with FUSE / Lustre     | Scales as needed                               |
| **Performance** | Max Throughput, Low Latency    | Managed Service for Lustre | Parallel File System, Low Latency              |
| **Access**      | POSIX Compliance (often)       | Managed Service for Lustre | Full POSIX Support, File Locking               |
| **Economics**   | Minimize Accelerator Idle Time | _Choose based on workload_ | Performance is more critical than storage cost |

### **Stage 3: SERVE**

| Metric          | Requirement                 | Recommended Solution(s)               | Key Feature                        |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| **Capacity**    | Model Files (100s of GBs)   | GCS with FUSE / Lustre / Hyperdisk ML | Easily handles model sizes         |
| **Performance** | Low Latency Model Loading   | Hyperdisk ML                          | High Aggregate Read Throughput     |
| **Access**      | Read-Only (many nodes)      | Hyperdisk ML                          | Multi-reader attach                |
| **Economics**   | Fastest Time-to-First-Token | _Choose based on scale/frequency_     | Efficient use of serving instances |

### **Stage 4: ARCHIVE**

| Metric          | Requirement                     | Recommended Solution | Key Feature                        |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Capacity**    | Extremely Large & Durable (PBs) | Google Cloud Storage | Built for Exabyte Scale            |
| **Performance** | Not a Primary Concern           | Google Cloud Storage | High throughput even on cold tiers |
| **Access**      | Write-Once, Read-Rarely         | Google Cloud Storage | Same API across all tiers          |
| **Economics**   | Absolute Lowest Cost per GB     | Google Cloud Storage | Nearline, Coldline, Archive Tiers  |
